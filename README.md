Machine Learning Foundations

This repository contains a collection of foundational machine learning notebooks focused on building strong preprocessing and modeling fundamentals using real-world datasets.

It covers:
~Data cleaning and missing value handling   \n
~Train–test splitting
~Feature transformation (log / function-based)
~Feature selection techniques
~Regression models (Linear, Multiple Linear, Polynomial)

The goal of this project is to understand how raw data is transformed into model-ready data and how different preprocessing steps impact model performance.

~Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
~Datasets: Titanic dataset, Retail sales data

This repository represents a consolidated ML learning pipeline rather than isolated beginner projects.
