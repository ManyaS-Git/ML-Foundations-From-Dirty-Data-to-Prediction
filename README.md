🚀 End-to-End Machine Learning Foundations

From Raw, Messy Data to ML-Ready Pipelines

📌 Overview

Real-world data is rarely clean, structured, or ready for machine learning.
This repository brings together multiple real-world datasets and projects to demonstrate a complete machine learning foundation workflow — starting from raw, inconsistent data and ending with clean, transformed, and feature-optimized datasets suitable for modeling.

Instead of treating each dataset as a separate beginner project, this repository consolidates them into one unified ML learning journey, reflecting how data science is actually practiced in industry.

🧠 What This Repository Demonstrates

This project focuses on the most critical (and often underestimated) part of machine learning — data preparation and feature engineering.

Core Skills Covered

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Handling missing and inconsistent data

Data cleaning and preprocessing pipelines

Feature transformation (log, scaling, encoding)

Automated and manual feature selection

Preparing datasets for downstream ML models

Extracting meaningful, business-oriented insights
